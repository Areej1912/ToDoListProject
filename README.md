# TO DO LIST APP- MY FINAL PROJECT FOR THE QA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP

**- Why are we doing this?**
To showcase all the topics covered and learned throughout the QA Software Development Bootcamp. Topics such as Java programming, working with databases, API development, testing etc

**- How I expected the challenge to go**
I expected the challenge to go reasonably well, as I have been working hard throughout the course, and feel as though I have a good understanding of the topics covered. However, I encountered many problems which resulted in my project not being fully developed/app unable to be deployed. 
**- What went well? / What didn't go as planned?**
I was able to write the code for CRUD functionalities, so the java programming aspect of the project went well. However, mysql refused to work with me, so I was unable to connect to a database, which impacted a lot of my project. my h2 console kept getting error messages. I spent a lot of time trying to fix problems that would keep persisting. 
I was also able to conduct a service unit test. 
**- Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.**
I would need more to time to work on the problems, find the issue with mysql etc. 
Will be working on this project after course anyway, and will hopefully be able to get it working.
